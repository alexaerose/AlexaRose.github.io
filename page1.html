	<h2>How "aroseandclothes" started?</h2>
	
<p>
	Three months into the coronavirus quarantine I found myself unmotivated and in need of a creative outlet. I am always looking for new merchandise to rep my college but found it was all too expensive or unoriginal. Yet as a person who always tries to do it myself I did some research and found a way to create my own one of a kind t-shirts. I began by making  Wisconsin tank-tops but as the demand increased I started taking orders for other schools as well. In addition I also began to sell t-shirts and sweatpants. In just a couple months I amassed a large social media following, shipped shirts around the world, and created meaningful relationships with customers. 
	I am so incredibly proud of the work I did and I believe it is a true testament to the determination and care I put into what I am passionate about.
